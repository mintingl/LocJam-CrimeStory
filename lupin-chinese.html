				<h1 class="title is-size-1"><b class="iluminated">T</b>he Arrest of <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b></h1>
<p>
It was a strange ending to a voyage that had commenced in a most auspicious
manner. The transatlantic steamship ‘La Provence’ was a swift and
comfortable vessel, under the command of a most affable man. The passengers
constituted a select and delightful society. The charm of new acquaintances and
improvised amusements served to make the time pass agreeably. We enjoyed the
pleasant sensation of being separated from the world, living, as it were, upon
an unknown island, and consequently obliged to be sociable with each other.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever stopped to consider how much originality and spontaneity emanate
from these various individuals who, on the preceding evening, did not even know
each other, and who are now, for several days, condemned to lead a life of
extreme intimacy, jointly defying the anger of the ocean, the terrible
onslaught of the waves, the violence of the tempest and the agonizing monotony
of the calm and sleepy water? Such a life becomes a sort of tragic existence,
with its storms and its grandeurs, its monotony and its diversity; and that is
why, perhaps, we embark upon that short voyage with mingled feelings of
pleasure and fear.
</p>
<p>
But, during the past few years, a new sensation had been added to the life of
the transatlantic traveler. The little floating island is now attached to the
world from which it was once quite free. A bond united them, even in the very
heart of the watery wastes of the Atlantic. That bond is the wireless
telegraph, by means of which we receive news in the most mysterious manner. We
know full well that the message is not transported by the medium of a hollow
wire. No, the mystery is even more inexplicable, more romantic, and we must
have recourse to the wings of the air in order to explain this new miracle.
During the first day of the voyage, we felt that we were being followed,
escorted, preceded even, by that distant voice, which, from time to time,
whispered to one of us a few words from the receding world. Two friends spoke
to me. Ten, twenty others sent gay or somber words of parting to other
passengers.
</p>
<p>
On the second day, at a distance of five hundred miles from the French coast,
in the midst of a violent storm, we received the following message by means of
the wireless telegraph:
</p>
<p>
“<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> is on your vessel, first cabin, blonde hair, wound right
fore-arm, traveling alone under name of R........”
</p>
<p>
At that moment, a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy skies. The
electric waves were interrupted. The remainder of the dispatch never reached
us. Of the name under which <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> was concealing himself, we knew only
the initial.
</p>
<p>
If the news had been of some other character, I have no doubt that the secret
would have been carefully guarded by the telegraphic operator as well as by the
officers of the vessel. But it was one of those events calculated to escape
from the most rigorous discretion. The same day, no one knew how, the incident
became a matter of current gossip and every passenger was aware that the famous
<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> was hiding in our midst.
</p>
<p>
<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> in our midst! the irresponsible burglar whose exploits had been
narrated in all the newspapers during the past few months! the mysterious
individual with whom Ganimard, our shrewdest detective, had been engaged in an
implacable conflict amidst interesting and picturesque surroundings. Arsène
Lupin, the eccentric gentleman who operates only in the châteaux and salons,
and who, one night, entered the residence of Baron Schormann, but emerged
empty-handed, leaving, however, his card on which he had scribbled these words:
“<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>, gentleman-burglar, will return when the furniture is
genuine.” <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>, the man of a thousand disguises: in turn a
chauffer, detective, bookmaker, Russian physician, Spanish bull-fighter,
commercial traveler, robust youth, or decrepit old man.
</p>
<p>
Then consider this startling situation: <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> was wandering about within
the limited bounds of a transatlantic steamer; in that very small corner of the
world, in that dining saloon, in that smoking room, in that music room! Arsène
Lupin was, perhaps, this gentleman.... or that one.... my neighbor at the
table.... the sharer of my stateroom....
</p>
<p>
“And this condition of affairs will last for five days!” exclaimed
Miss Nelly Underdown, next morning. “It is unbearable! I hope he will be
arrested.”
</p>
<p>
Then, addressing me, she added:
</p>
<p>
“And you, Monsieur d’Andrézy, you are on intimate terms with the
captain; surely you know something?”
</p>
<p>
I should have been delighted had I possessed any information that would
interest Miss Nelly. She was one of those magnificent creatures who inevitably
attract attention in every assembly. Wealth and beauty form an irresistible
combination, and Nelly possessed both.
</p>
<p>
Educated in Paris under the care of a French mother, she was now going to visit
her father, the millionaire Underdown of Chicago. She was accompanied by one of
her friends, Lady Jerland.
</p>
<p>
At first, I had decided to open a flirtation with her; but, in the rapidly
growing intimacy of the voyage, I was soon impressed by her charming manner and
my feelings became too deep and reverential for a mere flirtation. Moreover,
she accepted my attentions with a certain degree of favor. She condescended to
laugh at my witticisms and display an interest in my stories. Yet I felt that I
had a rival in the person of a young man with quiet and refined tastes; and it
struck me, at times, that she preferred his taciturn humor to my Parisian
frivolity. He formed one in the circle of admirers that surrounded Miss Nelly
at the time she addressed to me the foregoing question. We were all comfortably
seated in our deck-chairs. The storm of the preceding evening had cleared the
sky. The weather was now delightful.
</p>
<p>
“I have no definite knowledge, mademoiselle,” I replied, “but
can not we, ourselves, investigate the mystery quite as well as the detective
Ganimard, the personal enemy of <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oh! you are progressing very fast, monsieur.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all, mademoiselle. In the first place, let me ask, do you find
the problem a complicated one?”
</p>
<p>
“Very complicated.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you forgotten the key we hold for the solution to the
problem?”
</p>
<p>
“What key?”
</p>
<p>
“In the first place, Lupin calls himself Monsieur
R———-.”
</p>
<p>
“Rather vague information,” she replied.
</p>
<p>
“Secondly, he is traveling alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Does that help you?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Thirdly, he is blonde.”
</p>
<p>
“Well?”
</p>
<p>
“Then we have only to peruse the passenger-list, and proceed by process
of elimination.”
</p>
<p>
I had that list in my pocket. I took it out and glanced through it. Then I
remarked:
</p>
<p>
“I find that there are only thirteen men on the passenger-list whose
names begin with the letter R.”
</p>
<p>
“Only thirteen?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, in the first cabin. And of those thirteen, I find that nine of them
are accompanied by women, children or servants. That leaves only four who are
traveling alone. First, the Marquis de Raverdan——”
</p>
<p>
“Secretary to the American Ambassador,” interrupted Miss Nelly.
“I know him.”
</p>
<p>
“Major Rawson,” I continued.
</p>
<p>
“He is my uncle,” some one said.
</p>
<p>
“Mon. Rivolta.”
</p>
<p>
“Here!” exclaimed an Italian, whose face was concealed beneath a
heavy black beard.
</p>
<p>
Miss Nelly burst into laughter, and exclaimed: “That gentleman can
scarcely be called a blonde.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, then,” I said, “we are forced to the conclusion
that the guilty party is the last one on the list.”
</p>
<p>
“What is his name?”
</p>
<p>
“Mon. Rozaine. Does anyone know him?”
</p>
<p>
No one answered. But Miss Nelly turned to the taciturn young man, whose
attentions to her had annoyed me, and said:
</p>
<p>
“Well, Monsieur Rozaine, why do you not answer?”
</p>
<p>
All eyes were now turned upon him. He was a blonde. I must confess that I
myself felt a shock of surprise, and the profound silence that followed her
question indicated that the others present also viewed the situation with a
feeling of sudden alarm. However, the idea was an absurd one, because the
gentleman in question presented an air of the most perfect innocence.
</p>
<p>
“Why do I not answer?” he said. “Because, considering my
name, my position as a solitary traveler and the color of my hair, I have
already reached the same conclusion, and now think that I should be
arrested.”
</p>
<p>
He presented a strange appearance as he uttered these words. His thin lips were
drawn closer than usual and his face was ghastly pale, whilst his eyes were
streaked with blood. Of course, he was joking, yet his appearance and attitude
impressed us strangely.
</p>
<p>
“But you have not the wound?” said Miss Nelly, naively.
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” he replied, “I lack the wound.”
</p>
<p>
Then he pulled up his sleeve, removing his cuff, and showed us his arm. But
that action did not deceive me. He had shown us his left arm, and I was on the
point of calling his attention to the fact, when another incident diverted our
attention. Lady Jerland, Miss Nelly’s friend, came running towards us in
a state of great excitement, exclaiming:
</p>
<p>
“My jewels, my pearls! Some one has stolen them all!”
</p>
<p>
No, they were not all gone, as we soon found out. The thief had taken only part
of them; a very curious thing. Of the diamond sunbursts, jeweled pendants,
bracelets and necklaces, the thief had taken, not the largest but the finest
and most valuable stones. The mountings were lying upon the table. I saw them
there, despoiled of their jewels, like flowers from which the beautiful colored
petals had been ruthlessly plucked. And this theft must have been committed at
the time Lady Jerland was taking her tea; in broad daylight, in a stateroom
opening on a much frequented corridor; moreover, the thief had been obliged to
force open the door of the stateroom, search for the jewel-case, which was
hidden at the bottom of a hat-box, open it, select his booty and remove it from
the mountings.
</p>
<p>
Of course, all the passengers instantly reached the same conclusion; it was the
work of <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>.
</p>
<p>
That day, at the dinner table, the seats to the right and left of Rozaine
remained vacant; and, during the evening, it was rumored that the captain had
placed him under arrest, which information produced a feeling of safety and
relief. We breathed once more. That evening, we resumed our games and dances.
Miss Nelly, especially, displayed a spirit of thoughtless gayety which
convinced me that if Rozaine’s attentions had been agreeable to her in
the beginning, she had already forgotten them. Her charm and good-humor
completed my conquest. At midnight, under a bright moon, I declared my devotion
with an ardor that did not seem to displease her.
</p>
<p>
But, next day, to our general amazement, Rozaine was at liberty. We learned
that the evidence against him was not sufficient. He had produced documents
that were perfectly regular, which showed that he was the son of a wealthy
merchant of Bordeaux. Besides, his arms did not bear the slightest trace of a
wound.
</p>
<p>
“Documents! Certificates of birth!” exclaimed the enemies of
Rozaine, “of course, <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> will furnish you as many as you desire.
And as to the wound, he never had it, or he has removed it.”
</p>
<p>
Then it was proven that, at the time of the theft, Rozaine was promenading on
the deck. To which fact, his enemies replied that a man like <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> could
commit a crime without being actually present. And then, apart from all other
circumstances, there remained one point which even the most skeptical could not
answer: Who except Rozaine, was traveling alone, was a blonde, and bore a name
beginning with R? To whom did the telegram point, if it were not Rozaine?
</p>
<p>
And when Rozaine, a few minutes before breakfast, came boldly toward our group,
Miss Nelly and Lady Jerland arose and walked away.
</p>
<p>
An hour later, a manuscript circular was passed from hand to hand amongst the
sailors, the stewards, and the passengers of all classes. It announced that
Mon. Louis Rozaine offered a reward of ten thousand francs for the discovery of
<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> or other person in possession of the stolen jewels.
</p>
<p>
“And if no one assists me, I will unmask the scoundrel myself,”
declared Rozaine.
</p>
<p>
Rozaine against <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>, or rather, according to current opinion, Arsène
Lupin himself against <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>; the contest promised to be interesting.
</p>
<p>
Nothing developed during the next two days. We saw Rozaine wandering about, day
and night, searching, questioning, investigating. The captain, also, displayed
commendable activity. He caused the vessel to be searched from stem to stern;
ransacked every stateroom under the plausible theory that the jewels might be
concealed anywhere, except in the thief’s own room.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose they will find out something soon,” remarked Miss Nelly
to me. “He may be a wizard, but he cannot make diamonds and pearls become
invisible.”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” I replied, “but he should examine the lining
of our hats and vests and everything we carry with us.”
</p>
<p>
Then, exhibiting my Kodak, a 9x12 with which I had been photographing her in
various poses, I added: “In an apparatus no larger than that, a person
could hide all of Lady Jerland’s jewels. He could pretend to take
pictures and no one would suspect the game.”
</p>
<p>
“But I have heard it said that every thief leaves some clue behind
him.”
</p>
<p>
“That may be generally true,” I replied, “but there is one
exception: <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“Because he concentrates his thoughts not only on the theft, but on all
the circumstances connected with it that could serve as a clue to his
identity.”
</p>
<p>
“A few days ago, you were more confident.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but since then I have seen him at work.”
</p>
<p>
“And what do you think about it now?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Well, in my opinion, we are wasting our time.”
</p>
<p>
And, as a matter of fact, the investigation had produced no result. But, in the
meantime, the captain’s watch had been stolen. He was furious. He
quickened his efforts and watched Rozaine more closely than before. But, on the
following day, the watch was found in the second officer’s collar box.
</p>
<p>
This incident caused considerable astonishment, and displayed the humorous side
of <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>, burglar though he was, but dilettante as well. He combined
business with pleasure. He reminded us of the author who almost died in a fit
of laughter provoked by his own play. Certainly, he was an artist in his
particular line of work, and whenever I saw Rozaine, gloomy and reserved, and
thought of the double role that he was playing, I accorded him a certain
measure of admiration.
</p>
<p>
On the following evening, the officer on deck duty heard groans emanating from
the darkest corner of the ship. He approached and found a man lying there, his
head enveloped in a thick gray scarf and his hands tied together with a heavy
cord. It was Rozaine. He had been assaulted, thrown down and robbed. A card,
pinned to his coat, bore these words: “<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> accepts with pleasure
the ten thousand francs offered by Mon. Rozaine.” As a matter of fact,
the stolen pocket-book contained twenty thousand francs.
</p>
<p>
Of course, some accused the unfortunate man of having simulated this attack on
himself. But, apart from the fact that he could not have bound himself in that
manner, it was established that the writing on the card was entirely different
from that of Rozaine, but, on the contrary, resembled the handwriting of Arsène
Lupin as it was reproduced in an old newspaper found on board.
</p>
<p>
Thus it appeared that Rozaine was not <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>; but was Rozaine, the son of
a Bordeaux merchant. And the presence of <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> was once more affirmed,
and that in a most alarming manner.
</p>
<p>
Such was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none would remain
alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented parts of the vessel. We
clung together as a matter of safety. And yet the most intimate acquaintances
were estranged by a mutual feeling of distrust. <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> was, now, anybody
and everybody. Our excited imaginations attributed to him miraculous and
unlimited power. We supposed him capable of assuming the most unexpected
disguises; of being, by turns, the highly respectable Major Rawson or the noble
Marquis de Raverdan, or even—for we no longer stopped with the accusing
letter of R—or even such or such a person well known to all of us, and
having wife, children and servants.
</p>
<p>
The first wireless dispatches from America brought no news; at least, the
captain did not communicate any to us. The silence was not reassuring.
</p>
<p>
Our last day on the steamer seemed interminable. We lived in constant fear of
some disaster. This time, it would not be a simple theft or a comparatively
harmless assault; it would be a crime, a murder. No one imagined that Arsène
Lupin would confine himself to those two trifling offenses. Absolute master of
the ship, the authorities powerless, he could do whatever he pleased; our
property and lives were at his mercy.
</p>
<p>
Yet those were delightful hours for me, since they secured to me the confidence
of Miss Nelly. Deeply moved by those startling events and being of a highly
nervous nature, she spontaneously sought at my side a protection and security
that I was pleased to give her. Inwardly, I blessed <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>. Had he not
been the means of bringing me and Miss Nelly closer to each other? Thanks to
him, I could now indulge in delicious dreams of love and happiness—dreams
that, I felt, were not unwelcome to Miss Nelly. Her smiling eyes authorized me
to make them; the softness of her voice bade me hope.
</p>
<p>
As we approached the American shore, the active search for the thief was
apparently abandoned, and we were anxiously awaiting the supreme moment in
which the mysterious enigma would be explained. Who was <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>? Under
what name, under what disguise was the famous <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> concealing himself?
And, at last, that supreme moment arrived. If I live one hundred years, I shall
not forget the slightest details of it.
</p>
<p>
“How pale you are, Miss Nelly,” I said to my companion, as she
leaned upon my arm, almost fainting.
</p>
<p>
“And you!” she replied, “ah! you are so changed.”
</p>
<p>
“Just think! this is a most exciting moment, and I am delighted to spend
it with you, Miss Nelly. I hope that your memory will sometimes
revert—-”
</p>
<p>
But she was not listening. She was nervous and excited. The gangway was placed
in position, but, before we could use it, the uniformed customs officers came
on board. Miss Nelly murmured:
</p>
<p>
“I shouldn’t be surprised to hear that <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> escaped from
the vessel during the voyage.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he preferred death to dishonor, and plunged into the Atlantic
rather than be arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do not laugh,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly I started, and, in answer to her question, I said:
</p>
<p>
“Do you see that little old man standing at the bottom of the
gangway?”
</p>
<p>
“With an umbrella and an olive-green coat?”
</p>
<p>
“It is Ganimard.”
</p>
<p>
“Ganimard?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the celebrated detective who has sworn to capture <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>. Ah!
I can understand now why we did not receive any news from this side of the
Atlantic. Ganimard was here! and he always keeps his business secret.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you think he will arrest <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>?”
</p>
<p>
“Who can tell? The unexpected always happens when <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> is
concerned in the affair.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she exclaimed, with that morbid curiosity peculiar to women,
“I should like to see him arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“You will have to be patient. No doubt, <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> has already seen his
enemy and will not be in a hurry to leave the steamer.”

<p>
The passengers were now leaving the steamer. Leaning on his umbrella, with an
air of careless indifference, Ganimard appeared to be paying no attention to
the crowd that was hurrying down the gangway. The Marquis de Raverdan, Major
Rawson, the Italian Rivolta, and many others had already left the vessel before
Rozaine appeared. Poor Rozaine!
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it is he, after all,” said Miss Nelly to me. “What
do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I think it would be very interesting to have Ganimard and Rozaine in the
same picture. You take the camera. I am loaded down.”
</p>
<p>
I gave her the camera, but too late for her to use it. Rozaine was already
passing the detective. An American officer, standing behind Ganimard, leaned
forward and whispered in his ear. The French detective shrugged his shoulders
and Rozaine passed on. Then, my God, who was <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>?
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Miss Nelly, aloud, “who can it be?”
</p>
<p>
Not more than twenty people now remained on board. She scrutinized them one by
one, fearful that <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> was not amongst them.
</p>
<p>
“We cannot wait much longer,” I said to her.
</p>
<p>
She started toward the gangway. I followed. But we had not taken ten steps when
Ganimard barred our passage.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what is it?” I exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“One moment, monsieur. What’s your hurry?”
</p>
<p>
“I am escorting mademoiselle.”
</p>
<p>
“One moment,” he repeated, in a tone of authority. Then, gazing
into my eyes, he said:
</p>
<p>
“<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>, is it not?”
</p>
<p>
I laughed, and replied: “No, simply Bernard d’Andrézy.”
</p>
<p>
“Bernard d’Andrézy died in Macedonia three years ago.”
</p>
<p>
“If Bernard d’Andrézy were dead, I should not be here. But you are
mistaken. Here are my papers.”
</p>
<p>
“They are his; and I can tell you exactly how they came into your
possession.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a fool!” I exclaimed. “<b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> sailed under the
name of R—-”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, another of your tricks; a false scent that deceived them at Havre.
You play a good game, my boy, but this time luck is against you.”
</p>
<p>
I hesitated a moment. Then he hit me a sharp blow on the right arm, which
caused me to utter a cry of pain. He had struck the wound, yet unhealed,
referred to in the telegram.
</p>
<p>
I was obliged to surrender. There was no alternative. I turned to Miss Nelly,
who had heard everything. Our eyes met; then she glanced at the Kodak I had
placed in her hands, and made a gesture that conveyed to me the impression that
she understood everything. Yes, there, between the narrow folds of black
leather, in the hollow centre of the small object that I had taken the
precaution to place in her hands before Ganimard arrested me, it was there I
had deposited Rozaine’s twenty thousand francs and Lady Jerland’s
pearls and diamonds.
</p>
<p>
Oh! I pledge my oath that, at that solemn moment, when I was in the grasp of
Ganimard and his two assistants, I was perfectly indifferent to everything, to
my arrest, the hostility of the people, everything except this one question:
what will Miss Nelly do with the things I had confided to her?
</p>
<p>
In the absence of that material and conclusive proof, I had nothing to fear;
but would Miss Nelly decide to furnish that proof? Would she betray me? Would
she act the part of an enemy who cannot forgive, or that of a woman whose scorn
is softened by feelings of indulgence and involuntary sympathy?
</p>
<p>
She passed in front of me. I said nothing, but bowed very low. Mingled with the
other passengers, she advanced to the gangway with my Kodak in her hand. It
occurred to me that she would not dare to expose me publicly, but she might do
so when she reached a more private place. However, when she had passed only a
few feet down the gangway, with a movement of simulated awkwardness, she let
the camera fall into the water between the vessel and the pier. Then she walked
down the gangway, and was quickly lost to sight in the crowd. She had passed
out of my life forever.
</p>
<p>
For a moment, I stood motionless. Then, to Ganimard’s great astonishment,
I muttered:
</p>
<p>
“What a pity that I am not an honest man!”
</p>
<p>
Such was the story of his arrest as narrated to me by <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> himself. The
various incidents, which I shall record in writing at a later day, have
established between us certain ties.... shall I say of friendship? Yes, I
venture to believe that <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> honors me with his friendship, and that it
is through friendship that he occasionally calls on me, and brings, into the
silence of my library, his youthful exuberance of spirits, the contagion of his
enthusiasm, and the mirth of a man for whom destiny has naught but favors and
smiles.
</p>
<p>
His portrait? How can I describe him? I have seen him twenty times and each
time he was a different person; even he himself said to me on one occasion:
“I no longer know who I am. I cannot recognize myself in the
mirror.” Certainly, he was a great actor, and possessed a marvelous
faculty for disguising himself. Without the slightest effort, he could adopt
the voice, gestures and mannerisms of another person.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said he, “why should I retain a definite form and
feature? Why not avoid the danger of a personality that is ever the same? My
actions will serve to identify me.”
</p>
<p>
Then he added, with a touch of pride:
</p>
<p>
“So much the better if no one can ever say with absolute certainty: There
is <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b>! The essential point is that the public may be able to refer to
my work and say, without fear of mistake: <b class="has-text-danger-dark">Arsène Lupin</b> did that!”
